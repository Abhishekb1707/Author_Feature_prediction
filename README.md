# Author_Feature_prediction
tackled the challenge of predicting author characteristics from text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Leveraging a substantial dataset, we developed a sophisticated multilabel classifier capable of identifying author attributes like gender, age, industry, and astrological sign. Our workflow involved data preprocessing, text vectorization, and the implementation of a One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression approach for multilabel classification. We evaluated the model's performance with metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and precision-recall scores. This project illustrates the practical applications of NLP in profiling authors based on their writing style and content, offering valuable insights into the power of text analysis.
